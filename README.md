# IST402RPI-Tkinter-IOLab
A program designed to be a generic state/country feedback form with functionality such as drop-down menus, radio/checkbox buttons, a clear button, and an option to dump inputs to the console (or JSON/flat.) This program may still have bugs that need worked out. SQLite dumping currently doesn't work. Written in Python for my PSU IST 402RPI class.
